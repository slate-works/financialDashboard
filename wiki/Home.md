# Personal Finance Dashboard Wiki

Welcome to the Personal Finance Dashboard wiki. This wiki contains research, documentation, and guides related to the analytics engine, financial calculations, and system design.

## Research and Specifications

### Analytics Engine Research

The foundational research document outlines the complete analytics system design, including algorithms, formulas, and methodologies:

- **[Financial Analytics Engine Specification](../docs/finance-analytics-spec.md)** — Comprehensive engineering specification covering 12 core analytics features, formulas, test cases, and data models.

This specification serves as the technical foundation for all analytics features implemented in the dashboard. It includes detailed pseudocode, edge case handling, and references to academic literature and industry standards.

## Documentation

Additional project documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory:

- **[Project Guide](../docs/project.md)** — Architecture overview, technology stack, and development conventions
- **[Developer Guide](../docs/DEV_GUIDE.md)** — Development setup and workflow instructions

## Overview

The Personal Finance Dashboard is a self-hosted, offline-first financial analytics system designed for data ownership and privacy. The analytics engine implements research-backed financial planning principles, statistical methods, and time-series analysis to provide actionable insights from transaction history.

### Key Principles

- **Privacy-first**: All computation occurs locally; no external data transmission
- **Research-driven**: Algorithms based on CFP standards, academic literature, and industry best practices
- **Transparent**: All formulas and calculations are documented and auditable
- **Deterministic**: Analytics functions are pure and unit-testable where possible

## Future Content

This wiki will expand to include:

- Tutorials for using the dashboard features
- Guides for interpreting analytics results
- Explanations of financial metrics and their significance
- Best practices for data import and categorization
- Advanced configuration and customization options

## Contributing to the Wiki

Wiki content is maintained as markdown files in the repository. Contributions and improvements to documentation are welcome as the project evolves.
